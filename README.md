## About

**Colheita Feliz** (Happy Harvest) is a recreation of the classic farming game from the Orkut era — one of the most beloved games among Brazilian internet users in the late 2000s. This project builds the game **entirely from scratch** in C++ using SDL2, with no game engine and no AI-generated code.

Every single line of code is written by hand and explained step-by-step in the [YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/@harlleybastos). The series is recorded in **Portuguese (pt-BR)**, and code comments are also in Portuguese.

This is a learning journey — from zero to a fully playable isometric farming game.

## 🌿 Branch Strategy

Each branch corresponds to a specific episode of the video series. The code evolves incrementally — each episode builds on top of the previous one.

- **`main`** — Always contains the latest stable code (currently up to EP05).
- **`ep01-setup-sdl2`** — Code as it was at the end of Episode 01.
- **`ep02-janela-gameloop`** — Code as it was at the end of Episode 02.
- **`ep03-sprites-movimento`** — Code as it was at the end of Episode 03.
- **`ep04-isometrico`** — Code as it was at the end of Episode 04.
- **`ep05-tileset-sprites`** — Code as it was at the end of Episode 05.
- **EP06 through EP07** — Upcoming episodes (branches will be created as they are published).

To follow along with a specific episode, checkout its branch:

```bash
git checkout ep01-setup-sdl2
```

## 🎨 Assets

Sprites were generated using AI (**Google Gemini**) and manually adjusted in **Adobe Photoshop**.

- **Tileset:** 320×32px — 5 isometric tiles (64×32px each)
- **Character spritesheet:** 128×192px — 4 directions × 4 frames (32×48px per frame)

All assets are located in the `assets/` directory.
